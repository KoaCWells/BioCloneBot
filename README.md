# BioCloneBot
The BioCloneBot is an open-source automated liquid handler developed to satisfy the requirements of my Master's thesis at Concordia University. Every aspect of the project including the parts, software, and 3D models have been made freely available GPL v3.0 license.

Visual Studio 2022 is required to make modifications to the front-end and the Arduino IDE or VS Code is required to modify the device firmware. Solidworks 2022 is required to open the original 3D model files. STLs have also been provided for printing.
